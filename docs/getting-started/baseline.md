# BASELINE STATE — Project Life

> **Purpose:** Fix the irreversible starting point of Life evolution
> **Meaning:** From this moment, Life has a past

---

## Baseline Declaration

This document fixes the **baseline state** of the Project Life system.

From this point forward:

* No existing layer may be redefined in meaning
* No foundational document may be rewritten for semantic reasons
* All future changes are treated as **evolution**, not design

---

## Baseline Date

* **Declared:** 2026-01-13

## Layer State at Baseline

### Foundations (00–06)

* Status: **locked**
* Comment: philosophical and architectural base is closed

### Environment (07)

* Status: **implemented**

### State (08)

* Status: **implemented**

### Memory (09)

* Status: **minimal_form_defined**
* Comment: no semantic memory, storage only

### Perception (10)

* Status: **minimal_form_defined**

### Decision (11)

* Status: **minimal_form_defined**

### Action (12)

* Status: **implemented**

### Feedback (13)

* Status: **minimal_form_defined**
* Comment: documented but not yet integrated into runtime

### Layers 14–18

* Status: **conceptual / inactive**

## Consequences of Baseline

After this baseline:

* ❌ Rewriting past layers is forbidden
* ❌ "Better ideas" for completed stages are irrelevant
* ✅ Only new layers or extensions are allowed
* ✅ Life is treated as historically continuous

---

## Architectural Note

Baseline is not about perfection.

It is about **existence**.

From here on, Life does not restart.
It only continues.
