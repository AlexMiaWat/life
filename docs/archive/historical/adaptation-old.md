# 14 — ADAPTATION

## Layer role

Adaptation is the **ability of Life to change its own parameters** as a consequence of accumulated feedback.

This layer does **not**:

* pursue goals
* optimise outcomes
* evaluate success
* predict future states

Adaptation exists strictly as **structural plasticity**, not intelligence.

---

## Preconditions

Adaptation is allowed to exist **only because**:

* Action (12) is active
* Feedback (13) is active
* Action → Feedback interface is fixed

Without these, Adaptation is invalid.

---

## What Adaptation can change

Adaptation may adjust **only internal coefficients**, never meanings.

Allowed targets:

* reaction sensitivity
* decay / recovery rates
* internal thresholds
* stability damping factors

Explicitly forbidden:

* changing goals (no goals exist yet)
* changing action types
* introducing preferences
* redefining feedback meaning

---

## Direction of influence

```
Feedback (13) ───▶ Adaptation (14) ───▶ State (08)
```

Rules:

* Adaptation reads aggregated feedback
* Adaptation writes parameter deltas
* No direct effect on Action

---

## Failure tolerance

Incorrect adaptation:

* may destabilise Life
* may reduce integrity
* may cause collapse

This is acceptable.

---

## Architectural warning

If Adaptation ever:

* compares outcomes
* ranks consequences
* selects "better" states

Then **intelligence has leaked** and the architecture is broken.

---

## Status

Conceptual layer.
Not active.
