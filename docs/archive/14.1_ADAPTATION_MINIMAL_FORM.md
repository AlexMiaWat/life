# 14.1 — ADAPTATION MINIMAL FORM

## Purpose

This document defines the **minimal, non-intelligent form** of adaptation.

It exists to ensure:

* Adaptation can happen
* but cannot learn

---

## Input

Adaptation receives:

* aggregated feedback statistics
* time-windowed summaries
* no single-action context

No raw feedback records.

---

## Processing rule

Adaptation applies **blind adjustment rules**:

Examples (conceptual):

* if instability grows → increase damping
* if energy drains fast → reduce sensitivity

Rules are:

* static
* predefined
* non-optimising

---

## Output

Adaptation outputs:

* parameter deltas
* bounded values
* monotonic changes

No discrete decisions.

---

## Persistence

Adaptation effects:

* modify State (08)
* are reversible
* are not memorised as experience

Memory (09) is NOT used.

---

## Forbidden properties

Adaptation must NOT:

* store history
* compare periods
* detect patterns
* infer causality

---

## Status

Minimal form defined.
Not active.
